# xkcd-react
A React-based UI for the [xkcd webcomic](https://xkcd.com/). 

## Installation
To install, download the repository and run `npm install`
At the moment, you also have to enable CORS in your browser. Something like [CORS Toggle for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-toggle/jioikioepegflmdnbocfhgmpmopmjkim?hl=en) will do the trick easily.

## Running
To start the development version just run `npm start` and navigate to localhost:3000

## Roadmap
- [X] Use XKCD API to display comics
- [X] Make app usable without CORS enabled
- [ ] Add input to select exact comic to view
- [ ] Add some nice styles ðŸ”¥
- [ ] ???
